      <p>
        Hi! I'm Christopher Sponza, I am an undergraduate student at the CU Boulder graduating in the spring of 2025 and majoring in 
        Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Before becoming an engineering student I spent 6 years 
        in the US Navy as a Nuclear Machinist's Mate aboard the USS Toledo. I enjoy PCB design and working with microprocessors, particularly 
        writing code and sensor integration. In my free time I train and compete in ultra-marathons but also enjoy skiing, climbing, and 
        backpacking. Below is a link to some of my recent projects.
